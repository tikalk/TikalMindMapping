  description: Mainly worked on the Rails app with which the user interacts. I worked
    on both fronted and backend features, doing Rails MVC, Javascript and CSS.  Created
    Rails models and moving most of the logic into them, adding decorators and presenters,
    moving from plain CSS to Sass, integrating a css framework (foundation), and adding
    a lot of tests. With no Database at our disposal, I had to write some Ruby modules
    / classes which added some activerecord like methods to our models (basic associations,
    scopes, update_attributes, etc). Used RSpec & shoulda for unit / controller testing,
    with Capybara for integration testing. Used WebMock in controller tests to mock
    the reponses of external web services. For decorators we used Draper.
