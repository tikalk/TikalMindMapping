    DB and generate billing reports, my part was to Collect the requirements, design

  description: 'The purpose of the project was to built one stop shop for deploying
    (on the cloud), integrate and test products (standalone product delivered as a
    solution).                                                                                                                      My
    tasks as Full stack programmer were adding a feature: design, make DB changes
    (if any) and code the service layer to the display layer.  - The project was internal
    and saved lots of qa\dev working hours by running automatically the latest builds
    at nights (with the entire flow)  - The project used several tools and tools versions
    (for deploy, integration and test) that pluged-in to the infrastructure without
    ''touching'' the main code  - Working with hibernate (Mysql), CSA (HP cloud solution)
    and GWT - Manage the CI\CD process (SVN, Maven and Jenkins)'
