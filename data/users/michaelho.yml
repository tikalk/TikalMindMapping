  description: Mission was to develop an entire front end solution as part of an enterprise
    web platform for the customer.  This included developing a rails app with jquery/js
    on the client-side and ruby code on the server-side. The rails app communicates
    with the core back-end (which is written using the Sinatra framework) via JSON.
