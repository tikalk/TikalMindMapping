experience:
- title: Front End Developer @ Healarium
  years: 2012-Present
  description: At Healrium, I took part in rewriting the website's UI. My contribution
    was setting the standards bar and implementing a complete rewrite of the front
    end stack, transforming the current code into a maintainable, reusable and modular
    one and enable future deployment on a variety of mobile form factors. I used Django
    templating with HTML5, jQuery, Require.js for Front end and some Django and RDBMS
    for Back end. I also mentor junior developers and cooperate with QA and other
    personnel.
