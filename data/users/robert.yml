  description: 'My  mission was to converting a Drupal based website into a nodeJs
    + docpad website and building a Mobile web application for Forex trading, that
    give as much of the trade options available in their non-mobile trade application.  I
    used several open source tools and utilities based on a javascript stack, in order
    to automate some of the work on the website, and allow more control over it by
    the developers.  I worked with current  technology stack: NodesJS+Express on the
    server side to wrap an API of the Trade Engine. AngularJS on the browser to create
    the client side UI funtionality. Twitter Bootstrap was used for the Mobile App
    visual design.'
