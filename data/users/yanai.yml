  description: Initiating a new product for a new startup, which aims to anaylze SaaS
    cloud providers regarding security and file content management. I was building
    the architecture followed with a POC that scans organizations information on SaaS
    providers (i.e. GoogleDrive and Box.com). This scan includes users , files and
    events for these organizations, in order to provide content base knwledge for
    them, using the SaaS providers platforms. The POC is deployed at AWS and uses

  description: Architecting a new service product (running on Amazon), which servers
    as a portal of electronic-components for Mentor's users. The product is a Spring/Hibernate
    web application running on Tomcat, which includes text-search engine that enable
    users to search and store electronic components from multiple suppliers, and use
    the stored parts in Mentor tools. In addition, I implemented the model, persistence

    transaction configuration using Spring).
