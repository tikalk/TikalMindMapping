  description: 'I worked in the NMS (network managment system) team. The nms product
    provided by Ceragon to her clients give them the ability to manage all the mobile

    ejb, JAX-RS and eclipse rcp & java swing for client development The server in
    the product is JBOSS and the database is postgress. Teamcity was used as continuous
